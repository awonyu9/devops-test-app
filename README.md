<h1 align="center">Wartburg College Math Lab Resources</h1>

  <p align="center">
    This is part of Wartburg College's Math Lab's 2022-23 service project. Our team of 13 students decided that we wanted to serve our community by compiling useful resources on each of the course we tutor our fellow students in. At first, we were just going to gather it all in a Google Doc, but I volunteered to build a website instead, hoping that students would find a website with a nicer user interface easier to use than a plain Google Doc. So, I taught myself React Router to build it, and here we are!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="./readme-assets/homepage.png" alt="Screenshot of homepage">

I used React Router to build a multi-page website, where students can choose a subject (mathematics or computer science), then choose a specific course they need resources on. Each course page will list a number of useful links to videos, webpages, and tutorials, gathered by every member of the Math Lab 2022-23 team.
<br />
<br />
I've also designed the website so that it can be comfortably rendered with a dark theme, and it is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, as well.
